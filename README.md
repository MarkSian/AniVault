## Description

The world of anime is quite vast. There is a plethora of genres from adventure and comedy to horror and romance. It can be a bit intimidating and difficult to find what's right for you. That's where AniVault comes in. This application makes it easy to find new and exciting animes, or perhaps old and nostalgic animes that have slipped your memory. Choose your desired genre and let AniVault generate random animes for you to pick from. You can save them to your profile, hide them so that AniVault won't show them to you again, skip to the next anime, or go back just in case you want to give a suggestion another look. With AniVault you'll have a list of amazing animes in no time. So start searching and get to binging.

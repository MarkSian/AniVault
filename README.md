If I click on one of the genre buttons I am presented with details of a random anime. I can see the title, air date, star rating, rating, all of the genres it falls under, and a description. I am also given a NEXT button to go to the next anime, a HIDE button to hide the current anime so that it won't be shown again, and a BACK button to go to the previous anime.
